\title{Fit a Bayesian analysis of longitudinal networks}
\usage{
easybgm_longitudinal(
  data,
  type = "continuous",
  package = NULL,
  iter = 1000,
  centrality = FALSE,
  progress = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing the time series data of a
single subject. The data should be in long format,  where the columns
represent the variables and the rows represent the time points. See the
example data \code{\link{ts_data}} for the correct format.}

\item{type}{The type of the data to be fit.}

\item{package}{The R-package that should be used for fitting the network model; supports currently only tsnet.}

\item{iter}{number of iterations for the sampler.}

\item{centrality}{Logical. Should the centrality measures be extracted (default = FALSE)?}

\item{progress}{Logical. Should a progress bar be shown (default = TRUE)?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that are handed to the fitting functions of the packages, e.g., informed prior specifications.}
}
\value{
The returned object of \code{easybgm_longitudinal} contains several elements:

\itemize{

\item \code{parameters} A p x p matrix containing partial associations.

\item \code{inc_probs} A p x p matrix containing the posterior inclusion probabilities.

\item \code{BF} A p x p matrix containing the posterior inclusion Bayes factors.

\item \code{structure} Adjacency matrix of the median probability model (i.e., edges with a posterior probability larger 0.5).
}

For all packages, when setting \code{save = TRUE} and \code{centrality = TRUE}, the function will return the following objects respectively:

\itemize{

\item \code{samples_posterior} A k x iter matrix containing the posterior samples for each parameter (i.e., k = (p/(p-1))/2) at each iteration (i.e., iter) of the sampler.

\item \code{centrality} A p x iter matrix containing the centrality of a node at each iteration of the sampler.
}
}
\description{
Easy estimation of a Bayesian analysis of networks to obtain conditional (in)dependence relations between variables in a network.
}
\details{
Users may oftentimes wish to deviate from the default, usually uninformative, prior specifications of the
packages to informed priors. This can be done by simply adding additional arguments to the \code{easybgm} function.
Depending on the package that is running the underlying network estimation, researcher can specify different prior
arguments. We give an overview of the prior arguments per package below.

\strong{tsnet}:

\itemize{

\item \code{xx} xx

\item \code{xx} xx

}

We would always encourage researcher to conduct prior robustness checks.
