\usage{
easybgm_compare(
  data,
  type,
  package = NULL,
  not_cont = NULL,
  iter = 10000,
  save = TRUE,
  progress = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list with two n x p matrices or dataframes containing the variables for n independent observations on p variables for two groups. Note that the variables need to be the same in the two different dataframes.}

\item{type}{What is the data type? Options: continuous, mixed, ordinal, binary, or blume-capel.}

\item{package}{The R-package that should be used for fitting the network model; supports BGGM and bgms. Optional argument;
default values are specified depending on the datatype.}

\item{not_cont}{If data-type is mixed, a vector of length p, specifying the not-continuous
variables (1 = not continuous, 0 = continuous).}

\item{iter}{number of iterations for the sampler.}

\item{save}{Logical. Should the posterior samples be obtained (default = TRUE)?}

\item{progress}{Logical. Should a progress bar be shown (default = TRUE)?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that are handed to the fitting functions of the packages, e.g., informed prior specifications.}
}
\value{
The returned object of \code{easybgm} contains several elements:

\itemize{

\item \code{parameters} A p x p matrix containing difference across partial associations.

\item \code{inc_probs} A p x p matrix containing the posterior inclusion probabilities of subgroup differences.

\item \code{BF} A p x p matrix containing the posterior inclusion Bayes factors of subgroup differences.

\item \code{structure} Adjacency matrix of the median probability model (i.e., edges with a posterior probability larger 0.5).
}

In addition, for \code{bgms}, the function returns:

\itemize{

\item \code{structure_probabilities} A vector containing the posterior probabilities of all visited structures, between 0 and 1.

\item \code{graph_weights} A vector containing the number of times a particular structure was visited.

\item \code{sample_graphs} A vector containing the indexes of a particular structure.
}

For both packages, when setting \code{save = TRUE}, the function will also return the following object:

\itemize{

\item \code{samples_posterior} A k x iter matrix containing the posterior samples of parameter differences (i.e., k = (p/(p-1))/2) at each iteration (i.e., iter) of the sampler.
}
}
\description{
Easy comparison of networks using Bayesian inference to extract differences across conditional (in)dependence across groups.

\details{
Users may oftentimes wish to deviate from the default, usually uninformative, prior specifications of the
packages to informed priors. This can be done by simply adding additional arguments to the \code{easybgm} function.
Depending on the package that is running the underlying network estimation, researcher can specify different prior
arguments. We give an overview of the prior arguments per package below.

\strong{bgms}:

\itemize{

\item \code{interaction_scale} the scale of the Cauchy distribution that is used as a
prior for the pairwise interaction parameters. The default is 2.5.

\item \code{pairwise_difference_prior} prior on the graph structure, which can be either "Bernoulli" or "Beta-Bernoulli". The default is "Bernoulli".

\item \code{pairwise_difference_probability} prior edge inclusion probability for the "Bernoulli" distribution. an be a single probability or a matrix of p rows and p columns specifying the probability of a difference for each edge pair. The default is 0.5.

\item \code{pairwise_beta_bernoulli_alpha} and \code{pairwise_beta_bernoulli_beta} the parameters of the "Beta-Bernoulli" priors. The default is 1 for both.

\item \code{threshold_alpha} and \code{threshold_beta} the parameters of the beta-prime distribution for the threshold parameters. The defaults are both set to 1.

}

\strong{BGGM}:

\itemize{

\item \code{prior_sd} the standard deviation of the prior distribution of the interaction parameters, approximately the scale of a beta distribution. The default is 0.25.
}

We always encourage researcher to conduct prior robustness checks.
